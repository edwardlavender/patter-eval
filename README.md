[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable
state and is being actively

<sup>\*</sup>This repository is maintained by Edward Lavender

# Introduction

This repository contains methods, written in
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) and organised as an
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
[Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html), for the
evaluation of methods designed to reconstruct movements and/or patterns
of space use of tagged animals in passive acoustic telemetry systems.

Key elements of the workflow include:

- Simulation of arrays, movement paths and observations
  (e.g. detections);
- Implementation of approaches for the reconstruction of patterns of
  space use;
- Analyses of method performance under different conditions;
- Analyses of method sensitivity under different conditions;
- Analyses of method approximations under different conditions;
- Analyses of computation time under different conditions;

# Description

## Dependencies

The project was built in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 4.2.3)
in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and implements local dependency
management using
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). This
manages the installation of the
[`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) package (from
[GitHub](https://github.com/)), as well as other packages from the
[Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). The
first time the project is opened,
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) can be used
to regenerate the local project library, as described in `renv.lock`
(via `.Rprofile` and `renv/activate.R`).

## Directories

The project follows a standardised structure encouraged by the
[`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) package. The high-level
structure was generated via `dv::use_template_proj()`. The contents as
follows:

1.  **`renv/`** implements local dependency management.

2.  **`data/`** contains data files:

    - `sims/` contains simulation inputs and outputs:
      - `input/` contains inputs;
      - `output/` contains outputs from individual runs;
      - `synthesis/` contains synthesised outputs;
      - `inst/` contains [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
        [Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)-management
        files generated by [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv):
        - `dependencies.rds` is a list of dependencies;
        - `session-info.rds` is a record of information about the
          [R](https://www.r-project.org/) Session;
        - `tree.rds` is a record of the project directory tree (as
          generated by `dv::use_template_tree()` in `dev/02-dev.R`, see
          below); <br/>

3.  **`R/`** contains scripts for data processing and analysis:

    - `sim-data.R` simulates ‘observations’;
    - `prep-algorithms-prep.R` prepares for algorithm runs;
    - `run-algorithms.R` runs the algorithms using simulated datasets;
    - `analyse-performance.R` compares algorithm performance;
    - `analyse-sensitivity.R` analyses algorithm sensitivity to
      parameter mis-specification;
    - `analyse-approx.R` analyses algorithm sensitivity to parameter
      approximation;
    - `analyse-timing.R` analyses wall time; <br/>

4.  **`src/`** contains helper (`R`) functions.

5.  **`dev/`** contains project-management scripts.

    - `01-dev.R` and `02-clone.R` are standard
      [`dv`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/dv) scripts:
      - `01-dev.R` records project set up and development;
      - `02-clone.R` is used to clone the project (see ‘Instructions’);

6.  **`fig/`** contains figures.

7.  **`doc/`** contains supporting documents.

Note that the `data-raw/`, `data/` (except `data/inst/`) and `fig/`
directories are not provided in the online version of this repository.
However, all algorithm inputs/outputs can be reproduced by implementing
the code described below.

# Instructions

Follow the steps described below to clone the project and reproduce the
workflow.

Follow the steps described below to clone the project and reproduce the
workflow.

1.  **Clone the project** via GitHub. Follow the instructions in
    `dev/02-clone.R` to install packages and directories:

    - **Packages.** Work through `dev/02-clone.R` to use
      [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to
      regenerate the local project library. If you are lucky, this will
      work. However, installation with
      [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) can
      fail for packages that require external libraries (e.g., GDAL). If
      this happens, follow the instructions in `02-clone.R` to manually
      reinstall packages in the local project library. If both of these
      options fail, install the packages outside of the local project
      library (i.e., outside of the
      [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)
      environment and this [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
      [Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)) in the
      usual way and then ‘add’ them into the local project library by
      calling `renv::hydrate()` within this project. Once you’ve
      installed the packages, restart
      [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) before proceeding.  
    - **Directories.** Rebuild the project directory tree, via
      `dv::use_template_tree()`. This re-creates the folders required to
      store outputs.

2.  **Run the scripts** in order to simulate data, implement algorithms
    and analyse results.
